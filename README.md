# GifTastic!

This is a gif generator that uses the GIPHY API to generate a webpage of gif's of the users choice. This particular generator is animal themed. You can view the deployed project [here](https://chrishuman0923.github.io/GifTastic/).

# General Use

Once the page loads, the user will have a pre-defined list of animals that they can get gif's for. They simply click the button and the webpage returns 10 gif's from the GIPHY API. They gif's are still when first loaded but the user can click each gif to animate it and click to "pause" it again. The user can also submit their own animals and the page will render the submission as a new button that they can click to retreive gif's.

# Notes

All of the generator's behavior and functionality takes place without the browser window refreshing.
